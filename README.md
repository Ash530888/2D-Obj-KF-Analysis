# 2D-Obj-KF-Analysis
Analysing the accuracy of this 2D object tracking program (which uses the Kalman Filter) e.g. by calculating RMSE values and plotting graphs.
Code for plotting graphs and analysis of this KF implementation is in objTracking.py

I explore:
- Effect of Data Set on Prediction Accuracy
- Effect of Measurement Noise on Prediction Accuracy
- Effect of Changing Acceleration on Predictions
- How the Kalman Filter can Deal with Missing Observations

This 2D object tracking program is written by Rahmad Sadli- for better understanding look at his tutorial https://machinelearningspace.com/2d-object-tracking-using-kalman-filter/
